    <h1>KNOW ABOUT MY PERSONAL LIFE</h1> <br> 

    

    <div class="body">
        <p>I am a very consistent and punctual boy in my life. 

          I love to Writing storybooks as a pastime. I am also learning cycling so that I can keep myself healthy. I believe, one should practice a lot of sports to keep oneself healthy. A healthy mind works better. So, it is very important to keep yourself healthy to get focused. I am also very fond of watching various movies and I love to dance. I have learned many forms of dance ranging from hip-hop to breakdance.
            
            Being a lover of various dances, I also love to participate in various curricular activities in my school. I am an active participant in a bunch of fests organized by my school. Also, I have been a part of several quizzes debates, and tabloids. I have a huge interest in quizzes and have bagged many awards and honors to my school. Moreover, I always try to keep myself very punctual to school and help poor people whenever I get a chance.
            I love to research the undiscovered things in this world which is why I aspire to become a scientist just like my father and work for my country. I am always thankful to my family and my friends for making me so humble and helping me every day trying to show me the goal amongst the bunch of cloudy weather.

            Life is a jar of both happiness as well as sadness. Getting always what we want, is not the nature of life. Thus, one needs to keep oneself always motivated to the highest level. Follow the footprints of the great men to never be discouraged and keep yourself focused on your goal”.
            Introducing yourself can be one of the interesting as well as the most tricky task in itself. We all are unique and writing about ourselves is an essential aspect to discover our qualities more reliably. Discovering our qualities helps us a lot to know about ourselves. It is an essential element of building up one’s personality. Although, sharing them with the world is a matter of capability.Humans are prone to cynicism, and very often we pull ourselves down by reflecting our negative qualities on a higher note. What we actually need to do is to reflect more on the things we have planned about and what we are looking forward to. One can choose to explore their meritorious capabilities, which can range from developing hobbies to polished talents. This in turn will also work to boost your motivation towards any goal you set for yourself.
